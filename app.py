RigGPT v2.13.21
Features: Multi-TTS * Audio Effects * Voice Presets * SSTV * Scheduling
          Transmission Logging * Live Dashboard (SSE) * Beacon Mode
          Roger Beep * Waterfall Image Transmission * AI Integration Framework
          Acid Trip Mode * Alexa Mode * Clips Tab * Community Memory (Qdrant RAG)
          Dub FX (Trenchtown) * Multi-radio profile support * Discord integration
          Special Ops * Ghost-in-the-Machine (CI-V Possession Engine)

v2.12.38 changes:
  - FEATURE: Tab restructure -- CONFIG now contains radio connection + Discord only.
    New SYSTEM tab (audio, diagnostics, health, gong). New API CFG tab (all keys,
    LLM integrations, engine status). New SPEC OPS tab (all special ops features).
  - FEATURE: SPEC OPS tab with Ghost-in-the-Machine CI-V Possession Engine:
    VFO Poltergeist, Passband Possession, RF Power Wobble, AGC Seizure,
    Split Personality, Digital Ghost, The Exorcist (all ghosts simultaneously).
    All modes restore radio state on stop. Live possession log.
  - FEATURE: Discord Monitor and Control Channel panels now show a live
    server/channel/bot location row that updates on connection status change.
  - FEATURE: Special Ops config (numbers station, solar, mystery, autoid, pirate,
    roulette, ghost) all persisted to app_settings.json via cfgFlushPresets.
  - FIX: Config persist audit -- discord inject target/format, audio device,
    WF ART settings, SSTV VOX, beacon form defaults, trip gap fields were all
    missing from cfgFlushPresets. All now saved and restored on page load.
  - FIX: INSTALL.sh version detection now reads from the running service HTTP API
    before git pull overwrites app.py, so upgrade output shows correct
    'installed → incoming' instead of the same version twice.
  - README.md: Fully updated with tab layout, Ghost-in-the-Machine docs,
    Special Ops docs, CI-V safety notes, upgrade workflow.

NOTE: Version is defined by the VERSION constant in the Configuration section
below. When bumping versions, update ALL of the following in the same commit:
  - This docstring header
  - VERSION constant (below)
  - requirements.txt comment header
  - INSTALL.sh comment header and VERSION variable
  - templates/index.html status bar hardcoded version string (sb-label in statusbar)

v2.12.33 changes:
  - FIX: Beacon delete/pause/fire buttons threw 'beacon_1 is not defined' because
    onclick IDs were unquoted string literals. Added string quotes around ${b.id}
    in all three onclick handlers.
  - FIX: Beacon name showed 'Unnamed' even when a name was given. Backend stored
    empty string when name field was blank (data.get returns '' not default).
    Fixed: use `data.get('name','') or f'Beacon {minutes}min'`.
  - FIX: api_beacon_list now returns `active` field (mirrors `enabled`) so JS
    b.active checks work correctly. Previously only `enabled` was returned.
  - FIX: Removed `callsign` field from beacon config and API (unused).
  - FIX: Beacon validation now accepts sound_file as alternative to text.
  - FEATURE: Beacon SOURCE/MODE now includes 'clip' option -- plays a sound file
    from the Clips library over PTT at the scheduled interval.
  - FIX: WF ART duration field now correctly influences transmission. Computed
    frame_duration = duration / image_height so total TX time matches the field.
  - CLEANUP: Removed callsign handling from beacon and waterfall where it was
    unused cruft. callsign_text still works for the CALLSIGN canned image button.

v2.12.32 changes:
  - FIX: WF ART TX IMAGE 400 -- api_waterfall_transmit now accepts JSON body
    (application/json) in addition to multipart/form-data. Also accepts
    canned image name from JSON so wfTransmit() works without file upload.
  - FIX: SSTV transmit progress bar now animates in real-time while TX is
    in flight using per-mode duration estimates.
  - FEATURE: CW beacon option -- new 'cw' engine in beacon form. Synthesizes
    Morse code tones (800Hz, configurable WPM) via numpy, PTTs the rig and
    plays. Callsign appended as DE <CALL> AR automatically.
  - FEATURE: Schedule cron helper -- visual cron builder with minute/hour/DOM/
    month/DOW fields, common preset dropdown, human-readable preview.
  - FEATURE: Schedule sound file -- new CLIP type on schedule form; choose any
    file from Clips list; plays via PTT+aplay at schedule time, same as
    beacon CW path.

v2.12.31 changes:
  - FEATURE: Clips default directory changed from /opt/riggpt/clips to /sounds.
  - FEATURE: New GET /api/clips/test-path endpoint -- tests a directory path for
    existence, type (must be a dir), and read permission; returns file count.
  - FEATURE: New POST /api/clips/upload endpoint -- accepts multipart file upload,
    saves to configured clips dir (creates it if needed), triggers background
    rescan, returns per-file success/error details.
  - UI: Clips pane redesigned as radio-station automation panel:
    - 4 color-coded tiers (JINGLES/green, PROMOS/blue, SPOTS/amber, MISC/purple),
      6 cart buttons each = 24 total slots.
    - CART view: pre-populated buttons, empty until assigned to a file.
    - FILES view: original card grid (all scanned files).
    - Click empty slot to assign from scanned file list.
    - Click loaded button to transmit; x to clear assignment.
    - Cart assignments persisted in localStorage.
    - TEST PATH button in sidebar validates local directory.
    - UPLOAD section: file picker + drag-and-drop upload to /sounds.
    - SCAN button explicitly rescans both local and S3.
    - Info panel updated with new default path and feature docs.

v2.12.30 changes:
  - FIX: WF ART BW HZ default changed from 2400 to 2700 (HTML input, and both
    JS fallback values in loadCannedPreview() and wfGetProc()).
  - FIX (CRITICAL): createBeacon() JS sent key 'message' but api_beacon_create()
    reads data.get('text'). Field name mismatch caused every beacon creation to
    return HTTP 400 BAD REQUEST. Fixed: JS now sends key 'text' to match backend.
  - FIX: Clips tab button was missing from #cmdstrip tab bar. The pane HTML
    (id="pane-clips") and showTab('clips') handler both existed; only the button
    was absent. Added after ACID TRIP in tab bar.

v2.12.27 changes:
  - FIX (CRITICAL): @app.route('/api/ai/models') was attached to _ascii() instead
    of api_ai_models(). Every call to /api/ai/models raised TypeError (missing
    required argument 's'). The actual api_ai_models() was defined right below
    but never registered as a route. Fixed by swapping the decorator onto the
    correct function. _ascii() remains a plain module-level utility function.
  - FIX (CRITICAL): api_config_export() called api_beacons_list() and
    api_schedules_list() -- neither function exists. Actual names are
    api_beacon_list() and api_schedule_list(). NameError crashed any config
    export that included beacons or scheduled jobs.
  - FIX (CRITICAL): api_config_import() called api_beacon_add() -- function
    does not exist. Actual name is api_beacon_create(). NameError crashed
    any config import that attempted to restore beacons.
  - FIX (CRITICAL): api_config_import() called api_schedules_list() (same as
    export bug above). Fixed to api_schedule_list().
  - FIX: _ctrl_poller() used deprecated datetime.utcnow() (Python 3.12+
    raises DeprecationWarning). Replaced with datetime.now(timezone.utc).

v2.12.26 changes:
  - FIX: Version strings were diverged across codebase:
    docstring=v2.11.3, INSTALL.sh=v2.11.15, requirements.txt=v2.10.20,
    VERSION constant=v2.12.25. All now set to v2.12.26.
  - FIX: radio_docs_page() return tuple used double-brace syntax
    {{'Content-Type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8'}} -- this creates a Python
    set containing a dict (dicts are not hashable), raising TypeError at
    runtime on every request to /radio/docs. Fixed to single-brace dict.
  - FIX: set_antenna() returned (resp is not None) instead of
    (resp is not None and 0xFB in resp), silently returning True on a CI-V
    NAK. Now consistent with all other set_* methods in IcomSerialAgent.
  - IMPROVEMENT: Docstring now documents full feature set and includes a
    version-sync checklist to prevent future drift.

v2.11.3 changes:
  - REMOVED: Coqui TTS engine -- class, route, engine-status check, all references scrubbed.
  - FIX: termios.error EINTR retry: args[0] check instead of missing .errno attr; retries 3->5.
  - FIX: loadVoices() piper dict/array detection; Piper voices now show in dropdown.
  - FIX: Gong: tacoGong sent 'taco_bell' (no .wav); play_file lookup now uses TACO_BELL_FILE directly.
  - FIX: api() helper Content-Type guard prevents json parse on non-JSON responses.
  - NEW: /api/settings/gong_path GET/POST for configurable taco bell WAV path.
  - NEW: /api/ai/* Ollama integration framework (list models, chat, status).
  - UI: Voice preset buttons highlight on selection (active CSS class).
  - UI: TX/TTS: voice FX sliders (pitch, speed, tremolo, echo) with 8 effect presets incl AUTOTUNE.
  - UI: Gong button added to all pane bottom bars.
  - UI: Config: gong path config field + TEST button.
  - UI: New AI tab with Ollama host config and conversation interface.
  - UI: Coqui removed from all engine dropdowns.

v2.10.21 fixes:
  - BUG (CRITICAL): api_connect: int('0x98') raises ValueError because Python int()
    with default base 10 cannot parse hex strings. Fixed with int(str(x), 0) which
    auto-detects the base (handles '0x...' hex, plain decimal integers, both).
    This crash broke ALL /api/connect calls, cascading to PTT failure and band change
    failure since the radio connection was never being re-established after each
    Settings save or reconnect attempt.
  - BUG (CRITICAL): _radio_poller holds serial _lock for up to 12+ seconds per cycle
    when CI-V is not responding (8-10 reads x 1.5s timeout each). This completely
    blocks ptt_on()/ptt_off() which compete for the same lock, causing all
    transmissions to fire audio without PTT. Fixed two ways:
    (a) _poller_paused flag: set True in execute() before ptt_on, cleared in finally --
        poller thread skips all CI-V reads while flag is set.
    (b) Bail-early: if read_frequency() returns None, skip all remaining CI-V reads
        for that cycle and back off 2s before retrying. Prevents lock starvation.
  - BUG: S-meter BCD decode wrong. IC-7610 returns 4-digit BCD in 2 bytes but
    read_smeter() was treating them as a 16-bit binary integer.
    e.g. S9=0x00 0x60 in BCD -> parsed as (0x00<<8)|0x60=96 instead of decimal 60.
    Fixed: BCD decode via nibble extraction. Scale corrected (0=S0, 60=S9, 120=S9+60dB).
    _smeter_label() corrected to use the decoded decimal values.
  - BUG (JS): SSTV mode table shows "undefined" for all columns. /api/sstv/modes
    returns {modes: ['Robot36',...], meta: {Robot36: {width,height,...}}} but JS was
    treating r.modes as an array of objects. Fixed: JS now merges r.modes+r.meta into
    proper objects before rendering.
  - BUG (JS): SSTV family filter tabs never highlight the active tab. sstvFilterFamily()
    matched b.textContent ('ROBOT') against the filter arg ('Robot') -- case mismatch.
    Fixed: added data-fam attribute to each ftab button; match against that.
  - BUG (JS): CPU/MEM/TEMP/UPTIME dashboard widgets always show '-'. loadHealth() only
    populates the Config tab health grid; nobody ever fills dash-cpu/dash-mem/dash-temp/
    dash-uptime. Fixed: new pollSystemHealth() runs every 10s via setInterval and
    populates the dashboard widgets from /api/system/health response fields.
  - BUG (JS): All frequency POST calls sent {frequency: x} but backend reads
    frequency_hz or frequency_mhz. Fixed all 5 call sites.
  - BUG (JS): dashConnect sent baud_rate field; backend reads 'baud'. Fixed.
  - BUG (JS): radioControl() sent {action: 'ant1'} string; backend iterates key:value
    pairs with no 'action' handler. Fixed: proper payload per action type.
  - BUG (JS): loadCannedPreview sent JSON to multipart-form endpoint, used wrong field
    names (image vs canned), read wrong response field (image_b64 vs preview). Fixed.
  - BUG (JS): loadWaterfallCanned rendered images array as strings; backend returns
    [{id, label}] objects. Fixed.
  - BUG (JS): applyState read flat s.rf_power/swr/alc; backend SSE sends nested
    s.meters.po/swr/alc as {raw,pct} objects. Also read s.tx_active; backend uses s.tx.
    Fixed applyState() to use correct nested field paths.
  - IMPROVEMENT: /api/debug/civ GET scans all common IC-7610 CI-V addresses (0x80..0xA0)
    and reports which one responds -- operator can use this to identify the correct address.
  - IMPROVEMENT: /api/debug/log_level POST allows runtime verbosity change without restart.
  - IMPROVEMENT: send_command() now logs raw RX bytes at DEBUG level and includes
    port/ci_v/ctrl in the timeout warning for faster diagnosis.
  - IMPROVEMENT: execute() logs each stage (synth, effects, PTT on/off, playback) at
    INFO/DEBUG level with exc_info=True on errors.
  - BUG: api_waterfall_transmit: PTT not guaranteed off if ptt_on() succeeds but
    playback throws -- ptt_active flag pattern was missing, only bare try/except used.
    Added ptt_active guard + finally block matching the pattern used elsewhere.
  - BUG: AudioPlaybackAgent.play: leaked temp 'processed' WAV file on every call
    (ffmpeg normalized copy never deleted). Added finally cleanup for processed file.
  - BUG: AudioEffectsAgent.apply: leaked output_path temp file when sox_cmd raises
    (only input_path returned, output_path orphaned). Added finally cleanup.
  - BUG: AudioEffectsAgent.apply: mp3->wav conversion temp file ('wav') leaked on
    all code paths (no cleanup). Added cleanup tracking for the intermediate wav.
  - BUG: _radio_poller: _ctrl_tick stored as function attribute which does not
    survive module reload and may race. Moved to a module-level integer to be safe.
  - BUG: WorkflowOrchestrator.execute: audio_file temp not cleaned up if effects
    agent returns a *different* path. Fixed: track both pre-effects and post-effects paths.
  - BUG: api_ptt: no check that serial port is open before calling ptt_on/ptt_off.
    Added connected/open guard so UI PTT button returns 400 when radio disconnected.
  - BUG: Pyttsx3Agent.get_voices: engine not stopped after runAndWait(), leaving a
    zombie pyttsx3 process on Linux espeak backend. Added engine.stop() call.
  - BUG: api_audio_calibrate: _make_tone() temp WAV file leaked if sox raises.
    Fixed with try/finally inside _make_tone and the caller.
  - IMPROVEMENT: api_connect now logs the resolved ci_v integer for hex address confirmation.

v2.10.20 fixes:
  - Version string corrected throughout (was showing v2.10.15 in /api/status and banner)
  - INSTALL.sh: broken curl POST block that caused bash syntax error on line 158-161
  - INSTALL.sh: sox and espeak-ng missing from apt package list
  - requirements.txt: removed pyrtlsdr (SDR removed in v2.10.18); added edge-tts, gtts, pyttsx3, gunicorn
  - requirements.txt: pydub listed but never imported (removed)
  - WorkflowOrchestrator.execute: temp file cleanup used '/tmp/' string check -- fixed to use tmpdir prefix
  - WorkflowOrchestrator.execute: PTT left ON if playback_agent.play raises (ptt_off only in outer except)
  - api_sstv: PTT not turned off if encoding fails before ptt_on -- wrapped in try/finally with ptt_off guard
  - api_waterfall_transmit: PTT not guaranteed off on all exception paths -- added finally guard
  - api_audio_test: temp file leaked on failure path (os.remove not in try/finally)
  - api_schedule_add: schedule text captured by lambda closure -- late-binding bug, fixed with default arg
  - _radio_poller: no sleep/backoff on serial exception -- tight-loops on disconnect, added 5s backoff
  - api_status: version field hardcoded 'v2.10.15' -- now uses VERSION constant
  - EspeakTTSAgent: text passed as CLI argument is shell-injection-safe via subprocess list form (confirmed OK, no change needed)
  - Pyttsx3Agent.get_voices: engine.stop() should be engine.runAndWait() to properly shut down
  - SSTV image_to_sstv: add_vox_tones attr set but pysstv uses vox= in constructor -- use correct API
  - New: /api/transmit/preview returns estimated duration only -- now actually synthesizes to local file and plays locally (no PTT)
  - New: gunicorn+gevent used in systemd ExecStart for production stability
  - UI: complete rebuild (new dark-mode responsive frontend, SSE live dashboard, Chart.js activity graph)

v2.10.19 additions:
  - Full SSTV mode library: 20 modes across 6 families
  - Family filter tabs (Robot/Martin/Scottie/PD/Wraase/Pasokon)
  - Mode reference table with sortable family groups
  - VOX tone option, FSKID callsign footer, keep-aspect-ratio
  - Encode and preview WAV locally without transmitting
  - Download WAV for offline use
  - keep_aspect letterboxes image instead of stretching
  - Log SSTV transmissions to transmission history

v2.10.18 changes:
  - Removed RTL-SDR spectrum panel and SDRManager (UI cleanup)
  - Removed pyrtlsdr/numpy SDR imports

v2.10.17 fixes:
  - Module docstring was accidentally split, causing SyntaxError on Python 3.13
  - All non-ASCII characters replaced with ASCII equivalents (pure ASCII source)
  - tempfile.mktemp() replaced with tempfile.mkstemp() throughout (race condition)
  - Bare except clauses tightened to except Exception
  - INSTALL.sh: added plugdev+audio group membership for SDR/audio device access
  - INSTALL.sh: added librtlsdr-dev system package prerequisite for pyrtlsdr
  - INSTALL.sh: startup wait increased; route check uses /api/status not /api/log/stats
  - mathjs loaded without defer to guarantee availability at DOMContentLoaded
  - SDR canvas resize observer added for responsive layout

v2.10.16 additions:
  - SDRManager class: wraps pyrtlsdr with background IQ capture thread
  - Hann-windowed FFT -> dBFS averaging (4-frame), 20 fps SSE stream
  - /api/sdr/devices  -- enumerate connected RTL-SDR dongles
  - /api/sdr/start    -- open device, sync center freq from IC-7610
  - /api/sdr/stop     -- release device
  - /api/sdr/status   -- current SDR state
  - /api/sdr/stream   -- SSE FFT data stream consumed by frontend
  - Live spectrum panel below tab-body (always visible)
  - mathjs for dBFS scale and frequency axis math in canvas renderer
  - Graceful degradation when pyrtlsdr / numpy not installed

v2.10.7 fixes:
  - CI-V address default changed to 0x80 (IC-7610 common setting; was 0x98)
  - CI-V USB baud rate default changed to 57600 (was 19200)
  - CI-V response parser now correctly skips hardware echo (CP210x loopback)
    and waits for the actual radio response packet (src/dst byte check)
  - Auto-connect tries ttyUSB0/1/2 in correct order with CP210x scoring
  - Baud rate auto-scan in probe_radio() if initial response fails
  - Hardware interrogation endpoints: /api/radio/probe, /api/radio/ptt_test
  - Audio device detection improved for Burr-Brown TI PCM2901 (IC-7610 codec)
  - AudioPlaybackAgent logs all aplay attempts and errors clearly
  - Waterfall transmission skips ffmpeg loudnorm (already normalized)
  - datetime.utcnow() deprecation fixed (Python 3.12+)
  - pysstv.color import fixed (uses inspect for dynamic mode detection)

<h1>- RigGPT Radio Configuration</h1>
<p class="sub">Connection reference for supported Icom transceivers &mdash; v{VERSION}</p>

<h2>Supported Radio Models</h2>
<p>Select your radio in the RigGPT Dashboard (Connection panel &rarr; RADIO MODEL dropdown).
   This pre-fills the CI-V address and baud rate. The IC-7610 is the default and no changes
   are required if that is your radio.</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th>Radio</th><th>CI-V Address</th><th>Baud Rate</th>
  <th>udev Symlink Hint</th><th>Notes</th>
</tr>
{rows}
</table>

<h2>Step 1 &mdash; USB Serial (CI-V) Port</h2>
<p>RigGPT controls the radio via the CI-V protocol over USB. Each radio model presents a different
   USB serial device to the OS. The recommended approach is a persistent udev symlink so the device
   path never changes between reboots or cable replugs.</p>

<div class="box">
<h3>Create a persistent udev symlink (recommended)</h3>
<ol>
<li>Find the radio's USB vendor/product IDs:<br>
    <code>lsusb</code> while the radio is connected &mdash; look for Silicon Labs CP210x or FTDI entries.</li>
<li>Find the serial number (use <code>udevadm info /dev/ttyUSB0</code> or similar to identify the correct port).</li>
<li>Create <code>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-riggpt.rules</code>:<br>
    <code>SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{{idVendor}}=="10c4", ATTRS{{idProduct}}=="ea60", ATTRS{{serial}}=="YOUR_SERIAL", SYMLINK+="ttyIC7610"</code></li>
<li>Reload udev: <code>sudo udevadm control --reload-rules &amp;&amp; sudo udevadm trigger</code></li>
<li>Verify: <code>ls -la /dev/ttyIC7610</code></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="box warn">
<h3>Common USB serial IDs by radio</h3>
<p><strong>IC-7610, IC-7300, IC-9700</strong> &mdash; Silicon Labs CP2102: <code>idVendor=10c4 idProduct=ea60</code></p>
<p><strong>IC-7410, IC-7100</strong> &mdash; Silicon Labs CP210x: <code>idVendor=10c4 idProduct=ea60</code> (same chip, differentiate by serial number)</p>
<p>If you only have one Icom radio, the serial number step is optional &mdash; just match vendor/product.</p>
</div>

<h2>Step 2 &mdash; CI-V Address</h2>
<p>The CI-V address must match what is set in the radio's menu. Factory defaults are listed in the
   table above. To verify or change the address on the radio:</p>
<div class="box">
<h3>Reading / setting CI-V address on IC-7610</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press <code>MENU</code></li>
<li>Navigate to <code>SET &rarr; Connectors &rarr; CI-V &rarr; CI-V Address</code></li>
<li>Factory default is <code>98h</code></li>
<li>The address in RigGPT must match (enter as <code>0x98</code> or <code>0X98</code>)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h3>Reading / setting CI-V address on IC-7410</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press <code>MENU</code></li>
<li>Navigate to <code>SET &rarr; Connectors &rarr; CI-V Baud Rate</code> and <code>CI-V Address</code></li>
<li>Factory default is <code>6Eh</code></li>
<li>Set baud rate to match RigGPT (19200 default for 7410)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h3>Reading / setting CI-V address on IC-7300</h3>
<ol>
<li>Press <code>MENU</code></li>
<li>Navigate to <code>SET &rarr; Connectors &rarr; CI-V &rarr; CI-V Address</code></li>
<li>Factory default is <code>94h</code></li>
<li>IC-7300 supports up to 115200 baud &mdash; recommended for lowest latency</li>
</ol>
</div>

<h2>Step 3 &mdash; USB Audio</h2>
<p>RigGPT synthesizes speech and plays it into the radio's USB audio input. All listed radios
   have a built-in USB sound card. RigGPT auto-detects the correct audio device on startup
   by scanning <code>aplay -l</code> output for known chip identifiers.</p>
<div class="box">
<h3>If auto-detection picks the wrong device</h3>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>aplay -l</code> and find the correct card number for your radio.</li>
<li>Set the environment variable before starting RigGPT:<br>
    <code>RIGGPT_AUDIO_DEVICE=hw:2,0 python app.py</code></li>
<li>Or add it to your systemd service file under <code>[Service]</code>:<br>
    <code>Environment=RIGGPT_AUDIO_DEVICE=hw:2,0</code></li>
<li>The health panel in the Config tab shows the currently detected audio device.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="box warn">
<h3>Audio levels</h3>
<p>TX audio level is set in the radio menu, not in software. Start with the radio's
   USB AF Level at 50% and ALC at the standard position. Drive the audio until the
   ALC meter barely moves &mdash; this gives the cleanest signal.</p>
<p>For SSB voice modes (USB/LSB), the radio modulates the audio. For digital modes
   or SSTV, disable internal compression and use a flat audio response.</p>
</div>

<h2>Running Multiple Radios</h2>
<p>RigGPT supports one active radio connection at a time. To switch radios: disconnect,
   select the new radio model from the dropdown (which pre-fills CI-V address and baud rate),
   update the serial port if needed, and reconnect.</p>
<p>If you use two radios regularly, consider two separate RigGPT installations on different ports,
   or two systemd service instances with different <code>RIGGPT_AUDIO_DEVICE</code> and port settings.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<div class="box">
<h3>No CI-V response / timeout</h3>
<ol>
<li>Verify the serial port is correct: <code>ls /dev/tty*</code></li>
<li>Check that the RigGPT user has serial port access: <code>sudo usermod -aG dialout riggpt</code></li>
<li>Confirm CI-V address and baud rate match the radio menu exactly.</li>
<li>Try the PTT Test button in RigGPT &mdash; if PTT keys but freq readout fails, it is likely a CI-V address mismatch.</li>
<li>On IC-7610 / IC-7300 / IC-9700: ensure <code>CI-V USB &rarr; Unlink from [REMOTE]</code> is set if using USB control.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="box">
<h3>Audio transmits but sounds wrong</h3>
<ol>
<li>Confirm the radio is in SSB mode (USB recommended for voice). AM/FM mode will not work well with synthesized voice.</li>
<li>Run a PTT test in RigGPT and monitor your own transmission on a second receiver.</li>
<li>If audio is distorted, lower the USB AF Level in the radio menu.</li>
<li>If audio is too quiet, increase USB AF Level or check that the correct audio card is selected.</li>
</ol>
</div>
